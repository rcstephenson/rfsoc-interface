v0.1
- includes first three 2-channel boards fabricated, mounting holes were misaligned and did not physically fit on RFSoC. 
- Transmission lines are 50Ohm single ended grounded CPWs on input and 100Ohm differential microstrip lines before/after balun respectively. See XM500.pdf for original design info.

v1.0
- first fabricated version of board which works on RFSoC, same rf-lines, fixed position of mountion holes. 
- measuered I/Q data in loopback.
